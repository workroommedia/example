85,Median Family Income,"This indicator measures the median family income, which divides the income distribution into two equal parts: one-half of family households falling below the median income and one-half above the median.","Median family incomes have generally been outpaced by median housing prices, and are thus an indication of housing affordability and general prosperity. This indicator may not capture households who have left Austin for more affordable housing options outside of the city limits.","63,116","64,726","62,153","61,605","63,672","68,023","71,511","76,663","76,629","86,615",,USD,"This indicator measures the median family income, which divides the income distribution into two equal parts: one-half of family households falling below the median income and one-half above the median.","US Census Bureau, American Community Survey"
11,Homeless Count,This indicator measures the total number of persons who were identified and counted as homeless in the federally mandated Austin/Travis County Annual Point-in-Time Count. By its nature a count only includes persons who are homeless on the day of the count. Point-in-time counts tend to underestimate families and children and do not include individuals living in marginal situations.,"Homeless persons are often subjected to the elements, crime, and other maladies which often results in tragic consequences. Imagine Austin calls for reducing homelessness through supportive housing, mental health services/counseling, and alcohol/drug treatment.",,,"1,771","2,087","2,362","2,244","2,090","1,987","1,832","2,138","2,036",persons,"Between 2:00 a.m. and 9:00 a.m. on January 28th of each year, over 500 volunteers count the number of children, families and adults experiencing homelessness sleeping outdoors without shelter. Volunteer counted people in cars, tents, parks, under bridges, and on the streets. That same night, staff at agencies operating shelters and transitional housing programs count persons staying sheltered in their facilities as well.",Austin ECHO Point in Time Counts
34,Development Within Edwards Aquifer Zones,"This indicator measures the total developed land area inside the City of Austin and its Extra Territorial Jurisdiction (ETJ) portion of the Edwards Aquifer Recharge and Contributing Zones. The aquifer is an underground layer of porous limestone rock that stores water. The contributing zone is where rainwater flows over land into creeks that “contribute” water to the aquifer downstream. The Recharge Zone contains karst limestone where water infiltrates and flows into karst caves, cracks, and other openings to directly fill or “recharge” the aquifer. There is little to no filtration of water pollutants in this recharge process, and it is therefore critical to reduce the level of intensity of development in these areas and use best management practices to capture, treat, and infiltrate stormwater runoff.","The Edwards Aquifer is perhaps the most important environmentally sensitive asset that provides drinking water and feeds a number of springs in Austin, including Barton Springs and its pool. Imagine Austin calls for directing growth away from the Barton Springs Zone of the Edwards Aquifer recharge and contributing zones and other water-supply watersheds.",,93.7,,99.4,,102.9,,105.9,,107.5,,square miles,"The City of Austin creates a land use inventory every 2 years that identifies categories of land uses that can then be classified as developed or undeveloped. Parcel GIS layers from the appraisal districts are copied and appraisal information, building permits, and other source information is ""attached"" to the parcels. Land use data from the previous year is also attached. Parcels with new structures based on the appraisal or building permits are classified into a land use. The information is verified in many cases through aerial photos or other observations. The land use categories are totaled and summed by their acreage in GIS. Each category is then assigned either developed or undeveloped. 
For this indicator, the Edwards Aquifer Zones are considered to be all land within the ETJ that is in the Edwards Aquifer Recharge and Contributing Zones, including those north of the river.",City of Austin Land Use Inventory GIS Layer
35,Development within the 100 year Floodplain,This indicator measures the number of habitable buildings located in the 100-year floodplain. Floodplains are the areas likely to flood when our creeks rise and flow over their banks. Tracking development within the floodplain allows us to assess the risk to public safety. The 100-year floodplain is only suited for very limited development due to that risk. Numbers go down with City projects to remove or reduce risk to existing structures. Flood regulations prevent more structures from being introduced to the floodplain. Numbers can increase if areas with existing structures are annexed into the corporate city limits.,Imagine Austin calls for actions that reduce the threats flooding poses to public safety and private property.,,,,,,"2,380",,,,,"1,816",structures,The City of Austin Watershed Protection Department uses hydrologic & hydraulic engineering models and Geographic Information Systems (GIS) to map floodplains and then identify structures in the floodplain. Capital projects are implemented to reduce flood risk and the results are tracked in GIS.,City of Austin Watershed Protection Department
67,Vehicle Miles Traveled per Capita,This indicator is an estimate of daily vehicle miles traveled on public roads divided by a population. Vehicle miles Traveled (VMT) is a composite measure based on traffic counts from more than one source.,"Reducing VMT is a major goal of Imagine Austin. Increased vehicle use means increased pollution, congestion, delay, and a general breakdown and overuse of our transportation infrastructure. It is a reflection of sprawl development, separation of home and work, and poorly designed infrastructure.",19.33,18.16,17.55,16.75,16.78,15.88,15.98,16.34,,,,miles,Freeway Vehicle Miles Traveled and Arterial Vehicle Miles Traveled are summed and then divided by the total population.,Texas Transportation Institute
39,Environmental Integrity Index of Stream Water Quality,"This indicator measure the percentage of watersheds having good or better Environmental Integrity Index (EII) scores. EII is a comprehensive set of water quality measurements which collectively assess watershed health. The EII is a program designed to regularly monitor and assess the chemical, biological, and physical integrity of Austin’s creeks and streams. The overall EII score is a comprehensive reflection of the health and resilience of Austin’s creeks. Austin creeks are now assessed every other year. It can be used to identify where problems occur and may be used to track the success of Austin’s water quality protection efforts over time.","Imagine Austin calls for actions that strengthen flood control, erosion, and water quality programs, incentives, regulations, and enforcement to incorporate best practices and meet or exceed national standards. EII monitoring collects the data essential to track present conditions and progress towards meeting these goals.",,40,,58,,49,,55,,75,,percent,"The EII is a data collection system used to monitor and assess the chemical, biological, and physical integrity of Austin’s creeks and streams. Currently, all watersheds are monitored on a two-year rotating basis. More than 50 different types of parameters are measured to yield scores for contact recreation, non-contact recreation and aesthetics, water quality chemistry, sediment quality, physical integrity, and aquatic life support, which are combined into a single composite score. A rating of ""good"" means a given creek reach is in good overall condition and meets the minimum goals of the Watershed Protection Master Plan.",City of Austin Watershed Protection Department
41,Amount of Permanently Preserved Land,"This indicator measures the combined acreage of the City of Austin owned or managed lands that are permanently protected from development. This includes the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve (BCP), the Water Quality Protection Lands (WQPL), and nature reserves managed by the Parks Department. These lands are typically set aside for species and water quality protection. The goal of the BCP is to protect and enhance the habitat of endangered and rare species as mitigation for land development, as well as manage these forest ecosystems to protect water, air, and scenic resources. The primary goal of the WQPL is to produce the optimal level of high quality water to recharge the Barton Springs segment of the Edwards Aquifer by managing protected land to restore prairie-savanna ecosystems and healthy riparian corridors. Nature preserves share these and other goals. (Note: Preservation lands owned or managed by county, state, or federal entities, are not included in these totals but further contribute to these regional goals.)","Imagine Austin calls for actions that direct development away from sensitive environmental resources, protect existing open space and natural resources, and improve air and water quality.","41,001","41,170","42,647","42,658","42,690","42,698","43,383","44,561","44,587","44,569","44,575",acres,"Totals were generated by adding together acreage of City of Austin-purchased, owned, or managed lands in the WQPL program, BCP program, and designated ""Nature Preserves"" in the PARD inventory, including areas located within and outside the City of Austin’s full purpose jurisdiction.","Water Quality Protection Land program totals from 2006 and 2012 bond programs
